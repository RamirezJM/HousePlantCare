      <h2>Background</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>HousePlant Care is a conceptual mobile app that helps beginner plant owners diagnose common issues with their
        houseplants and receive simple, reliable care tips. The goal of the app is to reduce plant loss caused by
        misinformation or lack of accessible guidance, and to empower users to feel more confident in taking care of
        their indoor plants.</p>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Plant owners often struggle to identify what is wrong with their plants, especially when symptoms overlap
          (e.g., yellowing leaves can mean overwatering, underwatering, or lack of light).</li>
        <li>Online information is scattered and inconsistent, making it difficult for users to quickly find trustworthy
          advice.</li>
        <li>Beginner plant owners need a tool that is simple, friendly, and easy to navigate, without overwhelming them
          with technical details.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Role</h3>
      <p>UX Designer (solo project)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User research</li>
        <li>Problem definition</li>
        <li>Wireframing and prototyping</li>
        <li>Usability testing and iterations</li>
        <li>Visual design</li>

        <h3>Approach</h3>
        <p>The project followed a human-centered design approach. I conducted initial user research to understand common
          frustrations with houseplant care, synthesized insights into user personas, and defined the problem statement.
          I then sketched and created wireframes, built high-fidelity prototypes in Figma, and tested them with
          potential users. Based on feedback, I iterated the design to improve clarity and usability.</p>
      </ul>

      <h2>Research</h2>

      <h3>Research Goals</h3>

      <p>The main objective of the research was to understand the challenges that houseplant owners face when trying to
        identify and treat issues with their plants. The study aimed to uncover:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How users currently identify plant problems.</li>
          <li>The most common frustrations and barriers in caring for houseplants.</li>
          <li>Which features users would expect from a mobile app that provides plant care guidance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>

        <p>To gather insights, I conducted a combination of secondary research and primary user research:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><h4>Secondary research:</h4> I reviewed online plant care forums, gardening blogs, and social media groups to identify recurring topics and challenges.</li>
          <li><h4>Interviews:</h4> I carried out short semi-structured interviews with 4 participants who owned at least one houseplant.</li>
          <li><h4>Survey:</h4> I distributed a brief online survey to 10 respondents to validate the frequency of common plant issues and preferred solutions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Participants</h3>

        <p>The research participants were houseplant owners between 25 and 50 years old, living in urban environments. Most participants were beginners who had purchased plants for decoration or personal enjoyment during the past two years. They expressed varying levels of experience but shared similar difficulties in keeping their plants healthy.</p>


        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><h4>Uncertainty about plant names:</h4> Most participants did not know the exact names of their plants, making it difficult to look up solutions online.</li>
          <li><h4>Symptom-based thinking:</h4> Users were more comfortable describing what they saw (e.g., <span>“yellow leaves”</span>, <span>“tiny white bugs”</span>) rather than identifying diseases by name</li>
          <li><h4>Desire for quick, visual guidance:</h4> Participants preferred apps that use images, examples, or photo recognition rather than long text-based explanations.</li>
          <li><h4>Low tolerance for complexity:</h4> Users wanted a simple, clear app with minimal steps to find answers.</li>
        </ul>
