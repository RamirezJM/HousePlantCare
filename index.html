      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>HousePlant Care is a conceptual mobile app that helps beginner plant owners diagnose common issues with their
        houseplants and receive simple, reliable care tips. The goal of the app is to reduce plant loss caused by
        misinformation or lack of accessible guidance, and to empower users to feel more confident in taking care of
        their indoor plants.</p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Plant owners often struggle to identify what is wrong with their plants, especially when symptoms overlap
          (e.g., yellowing leaves can mean overwatering, underwatering, or lack of light).</li>
        <li>Online information is scattered and inconsistent, making it difficult for users to quickly find trustworthy
          advice.</li>
        <li>Beginner plant owners need a tool that is simple, friendly, and easy to navigate, without overwhelming them
          with technical details.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Role</h2>
      <p>UX Designer (solo project)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User research</li>
        <li>Problem definition</li>
        <li>Wireframing and prototyping</li>
        <li>Usability testing and iterations</li>
        <li>Visual design</li>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>The project followed a human-centered design approach. I conducted initial user research to understand common
          frustrations with houseplant care, synthesized insights into user personas, and defined the problem statement.
          I then sketched and created wireframes, built high-fidelity prototypes in Figma, and tested them with
          potential users. Based on feedback, I iterated the design to improve clarity and usability.</p>
